PhD Resume Optimization AI Agent
Overview
This project solves a specific problem: PhD holders in France struggling with resume selection due to overqualification bias. The AI agent analyzes job descriptions and provides targeted resume adaptations to maximize selection probability, offering concrete improvements, keyword optimization, and acceptance probability scoring. The system helps users strategically present their qualifications to match job requirements without losing authenticity.

1. Core Problem & Solution
The Problem
- PhD holders in France face systematic rejection due to overqualification bias
- Companies' AI screening systems filter out "overqualified" candidates automatically
- Need strategic resume adaptation without compromising professional integrity
- Current tools don't address PhD-specific challenges in the French job market

The Solution
An AI agent that:
1. Analyzes job descriptions to extract key requirements and preferences
2. Compares user's resume against job requirements
3. Identifies overqualification risk factors
4. Provides specific, actionable improvements
5. Suggests strategic keyword placement and emphasis
6. Generates acceptance probability score (0-100)
7. Creates adapted resume version with tracked changes

Key Outputs
- Detailed gap analysis: What's missing vs. what's excessive
- Strategic recommendations: How to reframe PhD experience for specific roles
- Keyword optimization: Which terms to emphasize/de-emphasize
- Acceptance probability score: Data-driven likelihood assessment
- Adapted resume: Professionally optimized version
- Change tracking: Clear before/after comparison
